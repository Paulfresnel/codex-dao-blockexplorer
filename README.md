Don't hesitate to leave comments on this github repo as to the features or functionalities you would like to be able to consult through our Block explorer and we will work on it.


## Technologies Used

* Our platform uses the ReactJs framework coupled with NodeJs, mixed with a multitude of API request calls (axios).

* We leverage the [AlchemySDK](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/alchemy-sdk-quickstart?a=eth-bootcamp) API methods to query the Ethereum blockchain. The AlchemySDK's core package wraps almost all of the `ethers.js` provider functionality.
